I’m a Product Manager at Google AI. I work on ML fairness in the context of model evaluation and understanding, leading product for the Fairness Infra team. I’m interested in bringing research techniques for detecting/mitigating algorithmic bias to production scale, and learning about implications for tech policy. 

Most recently, I launched [Fairness Indicators](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/12/fairness-indicators-scalable.html), a TensorFlow tool suite that enables regular computation and visualization of fairness metrics for binary and multi-class classification. I also helped to launch the [Model Card Toolkit](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/introducing-model-card-toolkit-for.html), a utility that helps developers generate transparency artifacts for their models, and the [Model Remediation Library](https://www.tensorflow.org/responsible_ai/model_remediation), which includes training and post-evaluation techniques that can be applied to mitigate unfair biases. 

* I graduated from Stanford with a BS and MS in CS in four years, concentrating in NLP and HCI. I published [research on detecting power relations](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W18-4511/) in speech via deep learning techniques. 
* At Stanford, I was a partner at [Dorm Room Fund](https://medium.com/@dormroomfund/the-26-students-powering-entrepreneurship-meet-dorm-room-funds-new-partners-2a2d83d7c9f0) (where I got to invest in awesome student-founded startups like [these](https://www.dormroomfund.com/companies)), president of [Women in CS](https://medium.com/@stanford.wics/a-welcome-note-from-the-wics-presidents-9a8cb33827b0), and director of [HackOverflow](http://web.stanford.edu/group/wics/hackoverflow/spr2016/), a beginner-friendly hackathon. 
* In the past, I’ve worked on [Pixel Software](https://events.google.com/io/schedule/events/08837fc5-b49c-4ac5-b5d5-ff2bf3869a48), [Local Services](https://ads.google.com/local-services-ads/), and Youtube Search in various PM and engineering roles. 
* I did a quarter abroad at Oxford, where I studied behavioral economics with [Dr. George Bitsakakis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgebitsakakis/?originalSubdomain=uk).  

I’m also an avid [reader](/reading), [hiker](/hiking), and alto for Google’s [Alphabeat](https://www.techapella.org/alphabeat).
